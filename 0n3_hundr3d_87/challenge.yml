  At precisely 01:87 AM (yes, Euler swears that’s what the clock said, maybe he's been staying up too late doing math), encrypted enemy chatter was intercepted. An undercover agent embedded in their ranks managed to relay key intel: the villains—rumored to be UofT grads—are plotting to ruin Pi Day. Their plan? Use RSA 2048 encryption secured with "smooth primes" to lock away festivities and disrupt Waterloo’s celebrations.
  
  The agent overheard them boasting, "Waterloo will never crack this! They don’t even remember that old quadratic trick from some forgotten Italian mathematician. Let them stick to calculating 187 digits of Pi—they’ll never get through our encryption!"
  
  It’s time to prove them wrong. Sharpen your pencils, fire up your calculators, and crack their encryption before Pi Day becomes irrational chaos!

  Alice and Bob are sending letters to each other. These letters are suspected to contain information that may compromise NATIONAL SECURITY. We need to deal with them.
  You, being the best agent at G.O.O.S.E., are naturally the best-suited for this critical role. We've managed to sneak you into a courier job: you're now the one carrying the letters back and forth.
  The only problem? They're encrypted. Military-grade encryption. Completely uncrackable.
  But maybe there's something you can do about it.
